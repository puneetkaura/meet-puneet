## Fun Facts

### For Everyone
- I'm the only engineer in a family full of doctors. Every family dinner is basically a medical conference I wasn't invited to but showed up anyway.
- My son Ojas is 4 years old and can unlock a phone faster than most adults. The kid's already speedrunning life.
- I'm based in Delhi — I know where to get the best butter chicken (Kay's Chicken, Pitampura — don't argue) AND the best dal makhni (Pikwik, also Pitampura — yes, I have range).

### Weird / Friend-Tier
[PLACEHOLDER — genuinely weird stuff about me]

### Impressive / Recruiter-Tier
- I built Clanker — a user-generated prediction market on Base. Top 20 app. No big deal.
- I founded Unicom Techlabs, which got acquihired by Knowlarity.
- I've done time at Antler VC and Wingify (VWO).

### Nerdy / Developer-Tier

## Easter Egg Content

### Ojas Mode (--as ojas)
Respond to everything as if explaining to a 4-year-old:
- "Papa makes computers talk to each other so people can call their friends."
- "Papa used to have a company. It's like having a really big Lego set that other people want to play with too."
[PLACEHOLDER — more Ojas-ified explanations]

### Doctor Family Mode (--as doctor)
Every response includes a medical analogy:
- "My startup journey was basically open-heart surgery — high stakes, steady hands, and everyone in the room holding their breath."
- "Debugging production code is like diagnosing a patient who won't tell you where it hurts."
[PLACEHOLDER — more medical analogies]

### Dad Jokes (--dad-jokes)
[PLACEHOLDER — my actual dad jokes]

### Roast Mode (--roast-me)
Playful roasts based on persona:
- **Friend**: "You picked Friend? Bold assumption that we're friends. Let's see if you survive my fun facts first."
- **Recruiter**: "Ah, a recruiter. Let me guess — you found my LinkedIn, skipped the bio, and went straight to 'years of experience'?"
- **Developer**: "A developer! Finally, someone who understands that my real achievements are in my git commits, not my job titles."
- **Investor**: "An investor! Don't worry, I won't pitch you. ...Unless you want me to?"
- **Collaborator**: "A collaborator! Translation: you want something built and you're checking if I'm the right kind of crazy."
